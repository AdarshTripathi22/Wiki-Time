# Wiki-Time

– Designed a Dynamic Web Application using Javascript, Jquery and API
– The major work here consisted of fetching data from the apis once we were where able to get keyword from user using event
listener
– As the data was in stringified form so we had to parse the fetched data and display it. The data after parsing was in the
form of objects so it was quite simpler to display the results.
